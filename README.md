A data engineering project for analyzing New York City taxi data. Explore comprehensive visualizations of taxi travel patterns, 
identify peak hours and high-demand locations, delve into detailed information for each trip. Use the insights to optimize taxi dispatch and enhance urban mobility.

A data engineering project for analyzing New York City taxi data. I have created a Datapipe
        line, which loads the data from google bucket (cloud storage), then used mage pipline to
        transform and process the data, then exports the data to Google BigQuery Warehouse. The mage
        pipeline itself is deployed on google Virtual Instance. Then, utilized looker dashboard to
        visualize and analyze the findings.
